    /** Problem statement

     You are given a string S of length N which encodes a non-negative number V in a binary form.
     Two types of operations may be performed on it to modify its value: if V is odd, subtract 1 from it; if V is even, divide it by 2.
     These operations are performed until the value of V becomes 0.

     For example, if string S = "011100", its value V initially is 28. The value of V would change as follows: V= 28,
     which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 14; V= 14, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 7; V= 7, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 6; V= 6,
     which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 3; V= 3, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 2; V=2 which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 1; V= 1,
     which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 0,
